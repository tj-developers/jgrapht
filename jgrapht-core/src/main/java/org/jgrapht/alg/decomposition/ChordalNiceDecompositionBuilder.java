/**
 * A builder for a nice decomposition for chordal graphs. See {@link NiceDecompositionBuilder} for
 * an explanation of nice decomposition.
 * <p>
 * This builder uses the perfect elimination order from {@link ChordalityInspector} to iterate over
 * the graph. For every node it generates a node for the predecessors of the current node according
 * to the perfect elimination order and builds a path to such a node from the node where the
 * greatest predecessor was introduced.
 * <p>
 * The complexity of this algorithm is in $\mathcal{O}(|V|(|V|+|E|))$.<br>
 * Consider the every node in the nice tree decomposition: There are exactly $|V|$ many forget
 * nodes. There are at most $2|V|$ additionally nodes because of a join nodes. Every join node
 * creates one additional path from root to a leaf, every such path can contain for every vertex at
 * most one introduce node, which yields $|V|^2$ introduce nodes. Now considering the bags of the
 * introduce nodes. On a path from root to a leaf we have at most one introduce node for every
 * introduced vertex. Since this introduced vertex is part of the clique of the least ancestor
 * forget node, the corresponding bag of the introduce node is smaller than the set of neighbors of
 * this vertex. Thus the time complexity is in $\mathcal{O}(|V|(|V|+|E|))$.
 * <p>
 * This is a non-recursive adaption for nice tree decomposition of algorithm 2 from here: <br>
