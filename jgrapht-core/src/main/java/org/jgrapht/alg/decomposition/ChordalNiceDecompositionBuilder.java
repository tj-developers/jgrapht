/**
 * A builder for a nice decomposition for chordal graphs. See {@link NiceDecompositionBuilder} for
 * an explanation of nice decomposition.
 * <p>
 * This builder uses the perfect elimination order from {@link ChordalityInspector} to iterate over
 * the graph. For every node it generates a node for the predecessors of the current node according
 * to the perfect elimination order and builds a path to such a node from the node where the
 * greatest predecessor was introduced.
 * <p>
 * The complexity of this algorithm is in O(). Consider the every node in the nice tree
 * decomposition: There are exactly $|V|$ many forget nodes. There are at most $2|V|$ additionally
 * nodes because of a join nodes. Every join node creates one additional path from root to a leaf,
 * every such path can contain for every vertex exactly one introduce node. Thus we have at most
 * $|V|^2$ introduce nodes. We have in total at most $|V|^2+3|V|$ nodes where the bag of every node has
 * at most as many nodes of the closet ancestor forget node for vertex $v$, which are $|N(v)|$ many. Thus the
 * time complexity is in $\mathcal{O}(|V|(|V|+|E|))$.
 * <p>
 * This is a non-recursive adaption for nice tree decomposition of algorithm 2 from here: <br>
