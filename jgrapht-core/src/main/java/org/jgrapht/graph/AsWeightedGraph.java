/**
 * Provides a weighted view on a graph.
 *
 * Algorithms designed for weighted graphs should also work on unweighted graphs. This class
 * emulates a weighted graph based on a backing one by handling the storage of edge weights
 * internally and passing all other operations on the underlying graph. As a consequence, the edges
 * returned are the edges of the original graph.
 *
 * Additionally, if the underlying graph is a weighted one, the weights can be propagated to it. The
 * default implementation does not propagate the changes, creating a weighted view only.
 *
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type
